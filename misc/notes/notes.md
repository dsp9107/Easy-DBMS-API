erp is what ?

you already have data stored somewhere and now just have to show it to the user as he requires. that is the simplest definition.

in addition to that, you need provide functionality to the user to create, read, update or delete data as per his requirement. what else ?

now the main thing to keep in mind is that it should look beautiful and be extremely accessible. so, you give the user all the freedom and flexibility to build his own dashboard, however he would like to visualize his data.

how do you build one ?

start with the fundamental unit; data. figure out a schema as in how will it be structured and then a way to store it in an easily accessible manner.

then comes CRUD operations on that data for which users need an interface to interact with their data.
